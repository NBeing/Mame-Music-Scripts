# Qsound-Scripts
Haven't touched these in awhile might as well release them
These are for newer versions of Mame
Example how to load up in mame
mame CPS2ROM -autoboot_script "qsound.lua"

Later cps2 games will most likely use QsoundZeroSav.lua I didn't bother adding a check for which games should use what.

Also, you need to use Notes.Lua as it was a lazy way to store what the note values are actually.
