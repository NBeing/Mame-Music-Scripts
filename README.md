# Music-Scripts
Haven't touched these in awhile might as well release them
These are for newer versions of Mame

# Example how to load up in mame

CPS2 Example
mame cps2rom -autoboot_script "qsound.lua"

Later cps2 games will most likely use QsoundZeroSav.lua I didn't bother adding a check for which games should use what.
Some of these are incomplete and could use some new features.

Also, you need to use Notes.Lua as it was a lazy way to store what the note values are actually.
